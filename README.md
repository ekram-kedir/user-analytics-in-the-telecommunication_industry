# user_analytics_in_the_telecommunication_industry


This project aims to assess the viability of acquiring TellCo, a mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia, through a detailed analysis of its telecommunication dataset. The focus is on extracting insights that can uncover growth opportunities and inform strategic decisions for potential buyers or sellers. Leveraging previous success in data-driven analysis for a delivery company, the goal is to replicate the methodology to drive profitability and business focus.

The project involves comprehensive data exploration, user engagement analysis, and the identification of areas for optimization within TellCo. The insights generated will be presented through an interactive web-based dashboard, providing a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to visualize and interpret the findings. The final deliverable will be a concise report containing strategic recommendations based on the data analysis.
